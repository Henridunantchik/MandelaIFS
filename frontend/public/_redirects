# Netlify redirects for SPA routing
# This ensures that all routes are served by index.html for client-side routing
# while maintaining proper 404 status codes for the custom 404 page

# Serve index.html for all routes that don't match static files
/*    /index.html   200

# Note: The React Router will handle showing the 404 component for unmatched routes
# The 200 status is correct here as we're serving the SPA, and the 404 logic is handled client-side
